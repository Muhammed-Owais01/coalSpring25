```asm
MOV AX 3d
```
#### There is no comma between destination and source operand

```asm
MOV 23, AX
```
#### Cannot move register into immediate value. Error

```asm
MOV CX, CH
```
#### Cannot move lower bit register value into higher bit register value. Both registers must be of same size

```asm
MOVE AX, 1h
```
#### Usage of "MOVE" instead of keyword "MOV"

```asm
ADD 2, CX
```
#### Cannot add register value to a immediate value

```asm
ADD 3, 6
```
#### Cannot add two immediate values like this

```asm
INC AX, 2
```
#### INC only increases value by 1. You cannot define how much to increment like this. Use ADD instead
